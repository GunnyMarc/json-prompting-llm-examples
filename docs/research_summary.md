## Conclusion

Research evidence strongly supports JSON prompting for:
- ✅ Data extraction and structuring
- ✅ Classification and categorization
- ✅ Multi-step reasoning with validation
- ✅ System integration tasks
- ✅ Batch processing workflows

Natural language prompting remains preferable for:
- ✅ Creative and artistic content
- ✅ Exploratory conversations
- ✅ Emotional intelligence tasks
- ✅ Nuanced human interactions

The optimal approach often combines both: JSON for structure and validation, natural language for flexibility and creativity.
